## Functionality:
The Dispatch app is designed with the following features:
- Interactive Map View

	The app is based on the view of google map. Users will be able to find nearby users and start a chat by clicking the user's icon.

- BlueChat

	The chat box allows user to send and receive messages both from single user or from multiple users using the broadcast function.

- SOS Signal Dissemination

	At the bottom of the map view, a user can conveniently enter a short message and broadcast it to all devices in BlueNet. This can be used in emergency cases for drawing everyone's attention to something of importance.
